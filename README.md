# Tic-tac-toe Frontend
**Demo available at [https://digistruct.cz/tic-tac-toe](https://digistruct.cz/tic-tac-toe)**

This repository holds the FE part of the tic-tac-toe game.

**Disclaimer**: it was attempted to rewrite the FE from basic HTML and JS into a Vue app. Due to severe lack
of time the FE is very bare bones without any proper styling but functionally works.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build

### Customize configuration

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in the `.env` file at the root location. It is possible
to create a `.env.local` file that will take precedence and overwrite values from `.env`.
